# MENTAL_HEALTH_DATASET_EDA
**Mental Health Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**📋 Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to mental health. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can provide meaningful contributions to understanding mental health challenges, their prevalence, and associated factors.

**📂 Dataset Information**

- **Name**: Mental Health Dataset- EDA
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Description**: The dataset contains information about age, gender, occupation, country, work hours and sleep hours to predict the mental health of individuals
- **Key Features**:
  - Age: Participant age
  - Gender: Gender of participants

**🛠️ Tools Used**

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

**📊 Steps in EDA**

1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Address missing values.
    - Handle inconsistencies in data (e.g., standardize gender responses).
    - Remove or treat outliers.
2. **Data Exploration**:
    - Summary statistics.
    - Distribution of numerical and categorical variables.
    - Correlation analysis.
3. **Visualization**:
    - Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots for distributions.
    - Heatmaps for correlations.
    - Bar plots for categorical variables.
    - Advanced visualizations (e.g., pair plots, violin plots).

**📈 Results**

- **Key Findings**:
  - Accuracy – 0.52

**🚀 How to Run the Analysis**

1. Clone the repository:
2. git clone <https://github.com/your-repo/mental-health-eda.git>
3. cd mental-health-eda
4. Install dependencies:
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
7. jupyter notebook Mental_Health_EDA.ipynb

**📚 Conclusion and Next Steps**

This analysis provides insights into mental health trends and factors. Future work could involve:

- Building predictive models to identify at-risk individuals.
